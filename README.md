# Sh4dow's Desktop Environment Installer (SDE)

# Overview

This guide teaches how to use the "Sh4dow's Desktop Environment Installer" (SDE)
which will be used to install window managers with custom settings, plus various
additional programs that will complement and enhance the desktop environment for
the user.

I will assume that you are comfortable with Linux based operating systems
and command line interfaces.

If you have a previous Debian installation, I recommend you to backup
your files and reinstall Debian. This because, can be problems if it
not is a clean installation.
